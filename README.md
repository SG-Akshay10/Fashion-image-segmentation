This code is focused on training an object detection model for fashion items using the YOLOv9 architecture. Here's a detailed documentation of the code:

Import Libraries and Load Data

The required libraries are imported, including pandas, matplotlib, PIL, json, and random.
The training annotations JSON file (instances_train2024.json) is loaded, and the categories and annotations are converted into pandas DataFrames.


Sampling Images from the Dataset

A random sample of 500 image IDs is selected from the dataset.
The annotations corresponding to the sampled image IDs are filtered and stored in a new DataFrame (final_sampled_annotations).


Visualizing Category Distribution

A bar plot is generated to visualize the number of items per category in the sampled dataset.


Test-Train Split

Categories with fewer than 50 images are filtered out.
The remaining dataset is split into train, validation, and test sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.
The category IDs are remapped to a contiguous range of integers.
The split datasets are saved as a JSON file (json_annotations.json).


Creating a Sample Image Folder

A new folder structure (main_dataset) is created with subfolders for train, validation, and test sets.
Images from the original folder (images/train/) are copied to the respective subfolders based on the split data.


Converting to YOLO Format

A new folder (yolo_data) is created to store the data in YOLO format.
For each dataset (train, validation, test), the images are copied to the respective subfolder (images), and the annotations are converted to the YOLO format and saved as text files in the corresponding subfolder (labels).


Finding the Number of Unique Classes and Class Names

The number of unique classes is determined from the filtered dataset.
The class names are extracted from the categories DataFrame and stored in a dictionary (names).


Creating a data.yaml File

A data.yaml file is created with the paths to the train, validation, and test datasets, the number of classes, and the class names.


Training the YOLOv9 Model

The YOLOv9 model is trained using the train_dual.py script from the yolov9 repository.
The training configuration, such as batch size, number of workers, and epochs, is specified.
The training results, including plots for metrics like confusion matrix and sample predictions, are displayed using the IPython.display module.


Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on the test set using the val.py script from the yolov9 repository.
The detect.py script is used to perform object detection on images from the test set, and the detected images are displayed.
